<p>
	I'm Nathan Xuan. I'm a senior CS major. I have lots of experience with Python and Java, and I'm familiar with C and C++. I also have limited experience with machine learning and NLP and I'm buildig a neural net model for CS585 to classify the truthfulness of political claims. I don't have a lot of experience with Javascript, HTML and CSS except for what's taught in this class.
