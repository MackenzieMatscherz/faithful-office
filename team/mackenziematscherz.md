I've done very little with html, css, and javascript.
I'm currently learning them now in this class and CS 120. 
I'm a Informatics and digital media student faking it in the data 
science track so I graduate with a non BDIC. I do a lot of design
things and have taken classes to create better designs for the 
average person to understand.
